Project Title:
Product Return Prediction using Logistic Regression

🧠 Objective:
To predict whether a product will be returned or not based on features such as:

Purchase Amount

Review Score

Days to Delivery

📁 Files Included:
product_return.csv – Dataset used for training and testing

AI_MSE_Report_Product_Return.pdf – Final report for submission

product_return_prediction.ipynb – Google Colab/Notebook code file (optional)

README.md – Project description and instructions

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:
Python 3.x

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Seaborn

Matplotlib

🔍 Methodology:
Load and clean dataset

Preprocess data (column renaming, target conversion)

Train-test split (80-20)

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate performance using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

📈 Sample Metrics:
Accuracy: ~85%

Precision: ~83%

Recall: ~78%

📊 Visualization:
Confusion matrix heatmap is generated using Seaborn to show model performance visually.
